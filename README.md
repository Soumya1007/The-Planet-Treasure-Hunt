# Technologies
I used HTML , CSS and JavaScript to set up the project and make it responsive. Html and Css made this website interactive and Javascript provided the fuctionalities to be performed on user action. To authenticate user and save user's information like email, name, accuracy and time taken , I used Firebase authentication and realtime database.
# Steps to set up the project
To set up the project simply download the files from gitHub. After downloading the files go to firebase and make a project with whatever name you ma like. After setting up the project add you configuration in the project instead of my configuration.

  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: ""
};
